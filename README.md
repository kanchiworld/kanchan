What is Kanchan?
-------------
Kanchan is digital currency created as a gift to Kanchan, AKA Kanchi, AKA Stuti by her dad
Gautam Tripathi. Kanchan also means "gold" in Sanskrit, a fitting name for a digital asset that
will eventually replace physical gold as a store of value. Kanchan enables instant, private
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Kanchan uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Kanchan Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Kanchan Core software, see https://www.kanchiworld.com.
